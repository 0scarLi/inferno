Inferno
=======

Inferno is an open-source python 
`map/reduce <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce>`_ library, powered by 
`Disco <http://discoproject.org/>`_, and focused on the following. 

    * A **query language** for large amounts of **structured text** 
      (csv, json, etc).
    * A continuous and scheduled **map/reduce daemon** with an HTTP interface 
      that automatically launches map/reduce jobs to handle a constant 
      stream of incoming data.
