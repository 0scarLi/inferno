Inferno Settings
================

You'll need to tell Inferno where your map/reduce rules are located, as well 
as the URL to the Disco master.

On your development machine, the recommended place to put these settings is in:
**~/.inferno**

The Inferno project comes with a few example rules. Download them from here, 
and place them in a directory called example_rules.
