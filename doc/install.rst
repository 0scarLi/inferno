Getting Started
===============

Disco
-----

Before diving into Inferno, you'll first need to have a working 
`Disco <http://discoproject.org/>`_ cluster (even if it's just a one node 
cluster on your development machine). 

This takes only few minutes on a Linux machine, and basically just involves the
following. See 
`Installing Disco <http://discoproject.org/doc/start/install.htm>`_ 
for complete instructions.

    * Install Erlang
    * Install Disco
    * Test your Disco install

Inferno
-------

Inferno is available as a package on the 
`Python Package Index <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/inferno>`_.

* `Easy Install <http://packages.python.org/distribute/easy_install.html>`_

::

    diana@ubuntu:~$ sudo easy_install inferno
    
* `Pip <http://www.pip-installer.org>`_
